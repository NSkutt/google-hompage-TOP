[WIP file] 
This is a project for The Odin Project and should look like the current 
Google homepage.
I have gotten even more friendly with searching for answers online and it 
sometimes seems like more is going into searching than coding. It is starting
to stick though and I'm hoping the next project won't need quite as much searching.
I am getting a lot more comfortable with grid and flex as the project progresses.
I'm also learning a few things that weren't covered in the course and a few things
that aren't actually necessary for the project while I'm trying to find what I 
need.
I found out that I went overboard with the hover properties after several days
 of work, but I'm leaving that stuff in. I've also learned how to use the Google
 Materials. I'm afraid I'm going to leave this site in a state of "static 
similarity" where the buttons don't highligt properly, the hover over causes a 
rectangular blank area to overlay the bottom and the colors don't quite match, 
but I'm attempting to avoid my perfectionistic tendencies on this site because 
I know I could spend another two weeks to a month attempting to learn how to fix 
it when I should be learning the building blocks of how the fix works. 

So I'll leave this as it is and push it up to github and see what the TOP people 
think.
