[WIP file] 
This is a project for The Odin Project and should look like the current 
Google homepage.
I have gotten even more friendly with searching for answers online and it 
sometimes seems like more is going into searching than typing. It is starting
to stick though and I'm hoping the next project won't need quite as much searching.
I am getting a lot more comfortable with grid and flex as the project progresses.
I'm also learning a few things that weren't covered in the course and a few things
that aren't actually necessary for the project while I'm trying to find what I 
need.
